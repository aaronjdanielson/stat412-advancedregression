# Week 1

Welcome to the Stat 412: Advanced Regression and Predictive Modeling! Of course the syllabus is on the [main page](https://github.com/natelangholz/stat412-advancedregression) of this repo.

## Week Overview

This week will see an introduction to the course seeing both a broad introduction to 'advanced' regression, reporoducible code and workflows, as well as a jump into a focused look at generalized linear models and maximum likelihood methods (maybe depending on time). There will be class introductions of myself, Aaron, and you all!
